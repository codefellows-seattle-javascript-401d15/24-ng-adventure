## AngularJS Controllers
  * controllers in Angular are best utilized when only attached the the view which instantiated it, since it only persists through the life cycle of the specific view it's bound to

## AngularJS Services
  * services typically handle application logic not specific to a single view and can be accessible to several controllers/components/directives/etc.
