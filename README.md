Welcome to the most exciting DMV simulator on the market today!
You play as a hapless wretch forced to visit the DMV to renew your driver's license.  Will you brave the trash-strewn parking lot? Will you make it to the lobby to watch CNN playing on a CRT tv?  Will you vanquish the evil vending machine and make it all the way to conquer the troll of the service counter?  

The Game Pad and Player Info elements describe the directions your player can move in and their characteristics.

The map and player service files define the characteristics for the player and the map.
