# What are the differances between Services and Controllers?
- Controllers are the part that handles the logic and tells everything what to do. Services can be injected into Controllers to make them do different things and holds a lot of the logic and information it seems. Services are often used to implement shared code between different controllers.
- Controllers can use the Services logic to advanced the amount of information and stuff that it can do and we use it here to manage our player and map procedural logic and state.
