## Difference between AngularJS Controllers and Services
* A service an an object or function available within the Angular application, to any number of controller, directives, or views.
  * Within the Angular application, services allow developers to create the functionality of the app without direct reference to the DOM.
* Controllers, alternatively, are typically attached to a specific page view, rather than general functionality.
